IMPORTANT NOTE:

To complete the college logo setup:

1. Replace the placeholder file at static/images/anand.jpg with the actual Anand College logo image.
2. The logo has been configured to display at the top of all pages in the application.
3. The logo height is set to 100px, but you can adjust this in templates/base.html if needed.

Once you replace the image file, the logo will appear correctly on all pages.
